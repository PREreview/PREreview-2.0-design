# Design Thinking: "Empathize" with your users

[PREreview.org](https://prereview.org/) stands for Post, Read, and Engage with preprint reviews, and it's a free platform for the 
collaborative writing of preprint reviews. PREreview seeks to diversify peer review in the academic community by crowdsourcing 
pre-publication feedback to improve the quality of published scientific output, and to train early-career researchers (ECRs) in how 
to review others' scientific work.

We want PREreview to be a name research communities associate with collaborative, constructive feedback and the moment in which 
itâ€™s valuable.

During the eLIFE Innovation Sprint, Head of Product Giuliano Maciocci helped the PREreview 2.0 team go over few key elements to understand
our users. 

### eLIFE Sprint PREreview 2.0 Team

We first identified PREreview key users

* General Users
* ECRs
* Experienced Researchers (Mentors)
* Preprint Authors
* PREreview staffers
* Journal Editors

... and then went on and wrote their stories using the format ["As a ... I want to ... in order to ..."]

Finally, we assigned a number, 1, 2, or 3 according to the following rubric:

**1** Absolutely necessary for the MVP (these are listed above)  
**2** It would be nice to have but only if we have time  
**3** Roadmap
